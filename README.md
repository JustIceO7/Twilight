# Twilight (Music Discord Bot)
A Discord bot written in Golang (v1.25.0+) that streams audio concurrently, manages song queues, and supports YouTube playback, playlists, and multiple guilds.  
  
Features intelligent audio caching with Redis-based TTL management and automatic cleanup of unused files.

## Architecture
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for user playlists.
- **Redis**: In-memory caching for song data.
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment with docker-compose for easy setup and management. All core dependencies (FFmpeg, yt-dlp, PostgreSQL, Redis) are pre-configured within the Docker containers.

## Docker Ports
- **8080**: Bot application.
- **6379**: Redis server.
- **5432**: PostgreSQL database server.
